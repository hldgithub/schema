<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<a name="ftnt1"></a>
<p>[1] In this section, we use the term "cognitive-behavioral therapy" to refer to various protocols that have been developed by writers such as Beck (Beck, Rush, Shaw, &amp; Emery, 1979) and Barlow (Craske, Barlow, &amp; Meadows, 2000) to treat Axis I disorders.</p>
<p>Some cognitive-behavioral therapists have adapted these protocols to work with difficult patients in ways that are consistent with schema therapy (c.f. Beck, Freeman, &amp; Associates, 1990). We discuss some of these modifications later in this chapter (see pp. 48-53). For the most part, however, current treatment protocols within cognitive-behavioral therapy do not reflect these adaptations.</p>

<p>[2] Our list of needs is derived from both the theories of others and our own clinical observation and has not been tested empirically. Ultimately, we hope to conduct research on this subject. We are open to revision based on research and have revised the list over time. The list of domains (see <a href="SchemaTherapy-figures.html#fig1.1">Figure 1.1</a>) is also open to modification based on empirical findings and clinical experience.<br/></p>

<p>[3] In contrast to some cognitive scientists, we define the term "cognition" in this section as <span class="s12">conscious</span> thoughts or images, not as "implicit" cognitions or simple sensory perceptions.</p>

<p>[1] All the forms and inventories mentioned in this book can be purchased as a packet from the Schema Therapy Institute. See the web site www.schematherapy.com for ordering information. These forms will be available in a forthcoming client workbook from The Guilford Press.</p>

<p>[2] The questionnaire is available in both long and short forms. The long form version of the YSQ (YSQ-L2) contains 205 items and assesses the 16 Early Maladaptive Schemas we had identified at the time the questionnaire was constructed. We have added additional items for the forthcoming workbook, so that all of the current 18 schemas can be measured. The long form is preferable for clinical use, because it reveals more subtleties of each schema and thus provides more detailed information.</p>
<p>The short form of the YSQ contains 75 items and is composed of the five highest loading items for each schema from the long form, as determined by factor analysis (Schmidt et al., 1995). We will be adding additional items to this form as well, so that all 18 schemas can be measured. The short form is frequently utilized for research studies because it takes much less time to administer.</p>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>[1] With patients with BPD, the therapist does not begin with cognitive work but focuses instead on forming a stable bond with the patient. This is discussed further in Chapter 9.</p>

<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<a name="ftnt7"></a>
<p>[1] Entitlement and Unrelenting Standards are schemas that often function as forms of overcompensation. However, they can also be "pure" schemas rather than forms of overcompensation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<a name="ftnt8"></a>
<p>[2] This belief that the "Vulnerable Child" is the core mode of the person is a philosophical assumption of our model. We recognize that it is not a universal truth.</p>

<h3>Chapter 9</h3>
<a name="ftnt9"></a>
<p>[1] Throughout the chapter, we use "she" and "her" to refer to patients with BPD since the majority of these patients are female.</p>
