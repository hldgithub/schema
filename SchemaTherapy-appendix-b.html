<h3>SCORING</h3>
<h4>Setting Up a Scoring Sheet</h4>
<p class="p1st">To score the Young Parenting Inventory, first make a scoring sheet with 3 vertical columns. At the top of the first column, write the heading "Name of Schema". Under this heading, copy the names of the schemas from the Early Maladaptive Schemas listing , along with the two-letter codes in parentheses next to each schema. For example, the first schema is Emotional Deprivation, and the two-letter code is ED.</p>
<p>Omit the fifth schema from your scoring sheet, Social Isolation/Alienation, since this schema is not measured by the YPI. (The origin of Social Isolation is usually in the peer group rather than in parenting.)</p>
<p>At the top of the second column, write the heading "Mother"; at the top of the third column, write the heading "Father." You will compute the score for each schema separately for the Mother and the Father, and write the score in the corresponding column.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Matching Items To Schemas</h4>
<p class="p1st">To match the items on the YPI with the names of the schemas, look for the asterisks and two-letter codes throughout the inventory. These codes match up to the two-letter codes on the listing of Early Maladaptive Schemas mentioned above. For example, *ed  refers to the Emotional Deprivation schema. All the items above the two-letter code correspond to that schema (until you reach the next code). For example, items 6 through 9 refer to the Abandonment schema (ab).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Computing Scores</h4>
<p class="p1st">For clinical use, we do not compute a mean or average. Instead, we count up the number of high scores for each schema for each parent, and record them on the scoring sheet.</p>
<p>Each item on the YPI is scored on a rating scale from "1" to "6." The first schema on the YPI, Emotional Deprivation, is scored backward: that is, low scores of 1 or 2 indicate high ratings. All of the other schemas are scored normally: that is, high scores of "5" or "6" indicate high ratings.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Interpreting the Scores</h4>
<p class="p1st">Until we have dependable norms for the YPI, we simply look at how many high scores the patient has for each parent for each schema. In clinical use, we usually discuss one parent at a time. First, we will usually review scores for the mother, and discuss with the patient which schemas the mother may have had a role in creating, based on how many high scores the mother was given for each schema. We then go through the same process with the father.</p>
<p>In general, a schema is likely to be more severe for a patient when there are several high scores, and when both parents are rated high on that schema. However, we should note that, in some cases, even one high score from one parent may be the primary origin of a severe schema. The therapist should also be aware that, with some patients, the origins of a particular schema may not appear on the YPI. The YPI contains the most common origins of each schema based on our clinical experience, not all possible origins.</p>
