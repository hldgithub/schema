<h3>FIGURE 1.1. Early Maladaptive Schemas With Associated Schema Domains</h3>
<h3 class="s12">DISCONNECTION AND REJECTION</h3>
<p class="p1st"><span class="s12">(The expectation that one's needs for security, safety, stability, nurturance, empathy, sharing of feelings, acceptance, and respect will not be met in a predictable manner. Typical family origin is detached, cold, rejecting, withholding, lonely, explosive, unpredictable, or abusive.)</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">1. <span class="s14">Abandonment / Instability</span></p>
<p>The perceived <span class="s12">instability</span> or <span class="s12">unreliability</span> of those available for support and connection.</p>
<p>Involves the sense that significant others will not be able to continue providing emotional support, connection, strength, or practical protection because they are emotionally unstable and unpredictable (e.g., have angry outbursts), unreliable, or present only erratically; because they will die imminently; or because they will abandon the individual in favor of someone better.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">2. <span class="s14">Mistrust / Abuse</span></p>
<p>The expectation that others will hurt, abuse, humiliate, cheat, lie, manipulate, or take advantage. Usually involves the perception that the harm is intentional or the result of unjustified and extreme negligence. May include the sense that one always ends up being cheated relative to others or "getting the short end of the stick."</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">3. <span class="s14">Emotional Deprivation</span></p>
<p>The expectation that one's desire for a normal degree of emotional support will not be adequately met by others. The three major forms of deprivation are:</p>
<ol class="s29b">
<li><span class="s12 s14">Deprivation of Nurturance:</span> Absence of attention, affection, warmth, or companionship.</li>
<li><span class="s12 s14">Deprivation of Empathy:</span> Absence of understanding, listening, self-disclosure, or mutual sharing of feelings from others.</li>
<li><span class="s12 s14">Deprivation of Protection:</span> Absence of strength, direction, or guidance from others.</li>
</ol>
<p class="p1st">4. <span class="s14">Defectiveness / Shame</span></p>
<p>The feeling that one is defective, bad, unwanted, inferior, or invalid in important respects or that one would be unlovable to significant others if exposed. May involve hypersensitivity to criticism, rejection, and blame; self-consciousness, comparisons, and insecurity around others; or a sense of shame regarding one's perceived flaws. These flaws may be <span class="s14">private</span> (e.g., selfishness, angry impulses, unacceptable sexual desires) or <span class="s14">public</span> (e.g., undesirable physical appearance, social awkwardness).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">5. <span class="s14">Social Isolation / Alienation</span></p>
<p>The feeling that one is isolated from the rest of the world, different from other people, and / or not part of any group or community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 class="s12">IMPAIRED AUTONOMY AND PERFORMANCE</h3>
<p class="p1st"><span class="s12">(Expectations about oneself and the environment that interfere with one's perceived ability to separate, survive, function independently, or perform successfully. Typical family origin is enmeshed, undermining of child's confidence, overprotective, or failing to reinforce child for performing competently outside the family.)</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">6. <span class="s14">Dependence / Incompetence</span></p>
<p>Belief that one is unable to handle one's <span class="s12">everyday responsibilities</span> in a competent manner, without considerable help from others (e.g., take care of oneself, solve daily problems, exercise good judgment, tackle new tasks, make good decisions). Often presents as helplessness.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">7. <span class="s14">Vulnerability to Harm or Illness</span></p>
<p>Exaggerated fear that <span class="s12">imminent</span> catastrophe will strike at any time and that one will be unable to prevent it. Fears focus on one or more of the following: (A) <span class="s12">Medical catastrophes</span> (e.g., heart attacks, AIDS); (B) <span class="s12">Emotional catastrophes</span> (e.g., going crazy); (C) <span class="s12">External catastrophes</span> (e.g., elevators collapsing, victimization by criminals, airplane crashes, earthquakes).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">8. <span class="s14">Enmeshment / Undeveloped Self</span></p>
<p>Excessive emotional involvement and closeness with one or more significant others (often parents) at the expense of full individuation or normal social development. Often involves the belief that at least one of the enmeshed individuals cannot survive or be happy without the constant support of the other. May also include feelings of being smothered by or fused with others or insufficient individual identity. Often experienced as a feeling of emptiness and foundering, having no direction, or in extreme cases questioning one's existence.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">9. <span class="s14">Failure</span></p>
<p>The belief that one has failed, will inevitably fail, or is fundamentally inadequate relative to one's peers in areas of <span class="s12">achievement</span> (school, career, sports, etc.). Often involves beliefs that one is stupid, inept, untalented, lower in status, less successful than others, and so forth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 class="s12">IMPAIRED LIMITS</h3>
<p class="p1st"><span class="s12">(Deficiency in internal limits, responsibility to others, or long-term goal orientation. Leads to difficulty respecting the rights of others, cooperating with others, making commitments, or setting and meeting realistic personal goals. Typical family origin is characterized by permissiveness, overindulgence, lack of direction, or a sense of superiority rather than appropriate confrontation, discipline, and limits in relation to taking responsibility, cooperating in a reciprocal manner, and setting goals. In some cases, the child may not have been pushed to tolerate normal levels of discomfort or may not have been given adequate supervision, direction, or guidance.)</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">10. <span class="s14">Entitlement / Grandiosity</span></p>
<p>The belief that one is superior to other people; entitled to special rights and privileges; or not bound by the rules of reciprocity that guide normal social interaction. Often involves insistence that one should be able to do or have whatever one wants, regardless of what is realistic, what others consider reasonable, or the cost to others; or an exaggerated focus on superiority (e.g., being among the most successful, famous, wealthy) in order to achieve <span class="s12">power </span> or <span class="s12">control</span> (not primarily for attention or approval). Sometimes includes excessive competitiveness toward or domination of others: asserting one's power, forcing one's point of view, or controlling the behavior of others in line with one's own desires without empathy or concern for others' needs or feelings.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">11. <span class="s14">Insufficient Self-Control / Self-Discipline</span></p>
<p>Pervasive difficulty or refusal to exercise sufficient self-control and frustration tolerance to achieve one's personal goals or to restrain the excessive expression of one's emotions and impulses. In its milder form, the patient presents with an exaggerated emphasis on <span class="s12 s14">discomfort avoidance:</span> avoiding pain, conflict, confrontation, responsibility, or overexertion at the expense of personal fulfillment, commitment, or integrity.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 class="s12">OTHER-DIRECTEDNESS</h3>
<p class="p1st"><span class="s12">(An excessive focus on the desires, feelings, and responses of others, at the expense of one's own needs in order to gain love and approval, maintain one's sense of connection, or avoid retaliation. Usually involves suppression and lack of awareness regarding one's own anger and natural inclinations. Typical family origin is based on conditional acceptance: Children must suppress important aspects of themselves in order to gain love, attention, and approval. In many such families, the parents' emotional needs and desires-or social acceptance and status-are valued more than the unique needs and feelings of each child.)</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">12. <span class="s14">Subjugation</span></p>
<p>Excessive surrendering of control to others because one feels <span class="s12">coerced</span>-submitting in order to avoid anger, retaliation, or abandonment. The two major forms of subjugation are:</p>
<ol class="s29b">
<li><span class="s14">Subjugation of needs:</span> Suppression of one's preferences, decisions, and desires.</li>
<li><span class="s14">Subjugation of emotions:</span> Suppression of emotions, especially anger.</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually involves the perception that one's own desires, opinions, and feelings are not valid or important to others. Frequently presents as excessive compliance, combined with hypersensitivity to feeling trapped. Generally leads to a buildup of anger, manifested in maladaptive symptoms (e.g., passive-aggressive behavior, uncontrolled outbursts of temper, psychosomatic symptoms, withdrawal of affection, "acting out," substance abuse).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">13. <span class="s14">Self-Sacrifice</span></p>
<p>Excessive focus on <span class="s12">voluntarily</span> meeting the needs of others in daily situations at the expense of one's own gratification. The most common reasons are: to prevent causing pain to others; to avoid guilt from feeling selfish; or to maintain the connection with others perceived as needy. Often results from an acute sensitivity to the pain of others. Sometimes leads to a sense that one's own needs are not being adequately met and to resentment of those who are taken care of. (Overlaps with concept of codependency.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">14. <span class="s14">Approval-Seeking / Recognition-Seeking</span></p>
<p>Excessive emphasis on gaining approval, recognition, or attention from other people or on fitting in at the expense of developing a secure and true sense of self. One's sense of esteem is dependent primarily on the reactions of others rather than on one's own natural inclinations. Sometimes includes an overemphasis on status, appearance, social acceptance, money, or achievement as means of gaining <span class="s12">approval, admiration,</span> or <span class="s12">attention</span> (not primarily for power or control). Frequently results in major life decisions that are inauthentic or unsatisfying or in hypersensitivity to rejection.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 class="s12">OVERVIGILANCE AND INHIBITION</h3>
<p class="p1st"><span class="s12">(Excessive emphasis on suppressing one's spontaneous feelings, impulses, and choices or on meeting rigid, internalized rules and expectations about performance and ethical behavior, often at the expense of happiness, self-expression, relaxation, close relationships, or health. Typical family origin is grim, demanding, and sometimes punitive: performance, duty, perfectionism, following rules, hiding emotions, and avoiding mistakes predominate over pleasure, joy, and relaxation. There is usually an undercurrent of pessimism and worry that things could fall apart if one fails to be vigilant and careful at all times.)</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">15. <span class="s14">Negativity / Pessimism</span></p>
<p>A pervasive, lifelong focus on the negative aspects of life (pain, death, loss, disappointment, conflict, guilt, resentment, unsolved problems, potential mistakes, betrayal, things that could go wrong, etc.) while minimizing or neglecting the positive or optimistic aspects. Usually includes an exaggerated expectation-in a wide range of work, financial, or interpersonal situations-that things will eventually go  seriously wrong or that aspects of one's life that seem to be going well will ultimately fall apart. Usually involves an inordinate fear of making mistakes that might lead to  financial collapse, loss, humiliation, or being trapped in a bad situation. Because they exaggerate potential negative outcomes, these individuals are frequently characterized by chronic worry, vigilance, complaining, or indecision.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">16. <span class="s14">Emotional Inhibition</span></p>
<p>The excessive inhibition of spontaneous action, feeling, or communication, usually to avoid disapproval by others, feelings of shame, or losing control of one's impulses. The most common areas of inhibition involve: (a) inhibition of <span class="s12">anger</span> and aggression; (b) inhibition of <span class="s12">positive impulses</span> (e.g., joy, affection, sexual excitement, play); (c) difficulty expressing <span class="s12">vulnerability</span> or <span class="s12">communicating</span> freely about one's feelings, needs, and so forth; or (d) excessive emphasis on <span class="s12">rationality</span> while disregarding emotions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">17. <span class="s14">Unrelenting Standards / Hypercriticalness</span></p>
<p>The underlying belief that one must strive to meet very high <span class="s12">internalized standards</span> of behavior and performance, usually to avoid criticism. Typically results in feelings of pressure or difficulty slowing down and in hypercriticalness toward oneself and others. Must involve significant impairment in pleasure, relaxation, health, self-esteem, sense of accomplishment, or satisfying relationships.</p>
<p>Unrelenting standards typically present as (a) <span class="s12 s14">perfectionism</span>, inordinate attention to detail, or an underestimate of how good one's own performance is relative to the norm; (b) <span class="s12 s14">rigid rules</span> and "shoulds" in many areas of life, including unrealistically high moral, ethical, cultural, or religious precepts; or (c) preoccupation with <span class="s12 s14">time and efficiency</span>, the need to accomplish more.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="p1st">18. <span class="s14">Punitiveness</span></p>
<p>The belief that people should be harshly punished for making mistakes. Involves the tendency to be angry, intolerant, punitive, and impatient with those people (including oneself) who do not meet one's expectations or standards. Usually includes difficulty forgiving mistakes in oneself or others because of a reluctance to consider extenuating circumstances, allow for human imperfection, or empathize with feelings.</p>

    <li>Feeling alone</li>
    <li>Thinking about her problems and her need for therapy</li>

</ol>
<h4>Severity of Schemas, Coping Responses, and Modes; Risk of Decompensation</h4>
<p class="p1st">Schemas are moderately strong. Coping responses and modes are very strong. No suicidal ideation. Low risk of decompensation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Possible Temperamental / Biological Factors</h4>
<p class="p1st">None</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Developmental Origins</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Mother was helpless and needy. Neither parent fulfilled Annette's emotional needs as a child.</li>
    <li>Father was angry and explosive. Annette was put in the role of protecting her mother from her father.</li>
    <li>Annette had no limits or discipline as a child. Could do and have whatever she wanted.</li>
    <li>Family members never shared feelings or discussed their problems.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Core Childhood Memories or Images</h4>
<p class="p1st">Father was very angry. Annette and her mother were frightened. Mother turned to Annette for help but did not offer any support, empathy, or protection for her.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Core Cognitive Distortions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>No one will ever be there to take care of my needs. I have to be the strong one all the time.</li>
    <li>There's something fundamentally wrong with me for having so many emotional problems and being so needy.</li>
    <li>Most men are unpredictable, angry, and explosive.</li>
    <li>I should be able to do and have whatever I want.</li>
    <li>I shouldn't have to stick with tasks, activities, or relationships that are boring or uninteresting.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Surrender Behaviors</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Does not ask others to nurture or protect her.</li>
    <li>Takes care of her mother and asks little in return.</li>
    <li>Does not talk about vulnerable feelings with other people.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Avoidance Behaviors</h4>
<ol>
<li>Abuses alcohol to block out painful feelings.</li>
<li>Seeks stimulation and novelty to avoid emotions.</li>
<li>Tries to avoid focusing on painful thoughts and feelings.</li>
<li>Avoids intimacy with men.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Overcompensating Behaviors</h4>
<p class="p1st">Acts tough and in control, even though she feels vulnerable and needy.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Relevant Schema Modes <span class="s7 s13">(in addition to the Healthy Adult)</span></h4>
<ol>
    <li>Tough Annette (Detached Protector)</li>
    <li>Little Annette (Lonely, Frightened Child)</li>
    <li>"Spoiled Annette"</li>
</ol>
<h4>Therapy Relationship <span class="s7 s13">(Impact of schemas and modes on in-session behavior; personal reactions and / or countertransference)</span></h4>
<p class="p1st">Annette acts tough much of the time in session. She is reluctant to admit strong attachment, neediness, or vulnerability toward me, even though she seems engaged and connected. She tries to avoid imagery exercises and doesn't like to talk about painful emotions or events. She often doesn't follow through on written homework assignments because she says they're boring or upsetting to her.</p>
<p class="p1st">Despite these problems, I find Annette engaging to work with and think we have a very good therapy relationship. I get somewhat frustrated by her lack of discipline and concern for others in the "Spoiled Annette" mode.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>FIGURE 3.2. Emily's Schema Diary</h3>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Trigger:</span> Jane said she wants to meet with me at three o'clock this afternoon.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Emotions:</span> I feel scared and want to hide.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Thoughts:</span> She'll tell me off and I won't know what to do. I can't stand up to her.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Actual Behaviors:</span> I agreed to meet with her. I'm filling out this form so I can figure out what to do.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Schemas:</span> I remember having to be available to my father and my first husband and how I had to be careful not to upset them. When they got angry, look out. Even now, I let my second husband tell me what to do, and he's nice. My Subjugation schema makes me want to give Jane whatever she wants so she won't get mad at me.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Healthy View:</span> I don't know what Jane wants to meet about. Anyway, I don't have to give her whatever she wants. I deserve respect and can end the meeting if she turns abusive.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Realistic Concerns:</span> Jane is very intimidating with people. She could yell at me. I'm not perfect at this job, but I'm getting better. I know she can find something I did wrong if she really wants to.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Overreactions:</span> I jumped to two conclusions. The first one is that Jane wants to berate me and the second one is that there's nothing I can do about it. That makes me feel passive and helpless, like the best I can do is just survive the meeting. This attitude paralyzes me.</p>
<p class="s63"><span class="s14">Healthy Behavior:</span> I can meet with Jane and find out what she wants instead of stewing about this. If she's rude, I can end the meeting. On the other hand, I might not be attacked, so I won't prepare to attack back. The bottom line is I have time to prepare and I can find a solution that works for me.</p>
