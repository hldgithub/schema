<h3>SCORING</h3>
<p class="p1st">To score this inventory, we simply circle all items with a high rating of "5" or "6". These represent the ways the patient avoids feeling or dealing with the emotions connected with his or her schemas. We discuss each of these high-rated items with the patient, asking for examples of when the patient can remember using this avoidance strategy or having this symptom. We then try to help the patient identify which schemas the patient is avoiding through these coping strategies or symptoms.</p>
<p>On a trial basis, some therapists are also breaking down the YRAI items into subscales, based on what we believe to be different avoidant strategies or symptoms. Below are our hypothesized subscales, with their corresponding item numbers in parentheses:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Intentionally not thinking about upsetting things (1, 31, 32)</li>
    <li>Substance abuse (2, 7, 9)</li>
    <li>Denial of unhappiness (3, 4, 29, 34)</li>
    <li>Excessive rationality and control (5, 17, 19, 35, 40, 41)</li>
    <li>Suppression of anger (6, 13, 18)</li>
    <li>Psychosomatic symptoms (10, 12, 15, 38)</li>
    <li>Withdrawal from people (13, 20, 30)</li>
    <li>Denial of memories (8, 21, 27)</li>
    <li>Avoidance through sleep / lack of energy (14, 22)</li>
    <li>Distraction through activity (23, 24, 28)</li>
    <li>Self-soothing (eating, shopping, etc.) (9, 26, 36)</li>
    <li>Passive blocking of upsetting emotions (11, 33, 39, 40)</li>
    <li>Passive distraction: Fantasy, daydreaming, television  (16, 25)</li>
    <li>Avoidance of upsetting situations (37)</li>
</ol>
