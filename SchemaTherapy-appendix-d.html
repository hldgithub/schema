<h3>SCORING</h3>
<p class="p1st">To score this inventory, we simply circle all items with a high rating of "5" or "6". These represent the ways the patient overcompensates for emotions connected with his or her schemas. We discuss each of these high-rated items with the patient, asking for examples of when the patient can remember using this compensatory strategy. We then try to help the patient identify which schemas the patient is compensating for through these coping strategies.</p>
<p>The same form of overcompensation could be used to cope with many different schemas. Thus, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between each item on the YCI and any schema. However, the table below lists some of the most common schemas associated with each of the items on the YCI, based on our clinical observation.</p>
